<h2>Design</h2>
<h4>Colours</h4>
<p>The colour I used for the background was #F5F5F5, I went for this as it was easy on the eyes and is not to distracted the user when they need to read the information off the job board for an example.</p>

<h4>Images</h4>
<p>I only used one image and that was for my logo that was created by using Shopify Logo Maker</p>

<h4>Fonts</h4>
<p>The Poppins font is the main font of the website. Sans Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The font was imported via Google Fonts.</p>

<h2>Agile</h2>
<p>
    I used the github projects to manage the app whilst using the Agile Method.
    I created 10 user stories both from the users side and external users side, with acceptable acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks in order to complete the user story.
    You can click <a href="https://github.com/users/JoshRudge22/projects/5/views/1">here</a> to view them.

<h2>Data Model</h2>

![Data Model](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/f0ab4133-dc2c-48e7-8f96-67f233aaf214)
<ul>
    <li>ContactUsForm: Represents a form for users to contact the website. It includes fields for name, email, phone number, message, and preferred contact time.</li>
    <li>Hiring: Represents a hiring process when the user is filling this form out its to get their job on our website. It includes fields for company name, email, phone number, job description, and documentation.</li>
    <li>Job: Represents a job listing or job posting. It includes fields for job title, job benefits, address, job details, job requirements, interview deadline, availability times, hire status, and notes.</li>
    <li>AvailableTime: Represents available times for job interviews. It includes fields for different time slots. I have an hour beween the times as an example of how long the interview will go on for. These can easily be edited r add new times via the admin panel.</li>
    <li>Profile: Represents user profiles. It includes fields for user information such as email, phone number, CV (resume), address, post code, and notice times.</li>
    <li>NoticeTimes: Represents notice times for job applications. It includes fields for different notice periods, as an example some people may have a week notice they need to hand in when they are looking to leave a job. We can add more notice times if need via the admin panel.</li>
    <li>JobApplication: Represents job applications submitted by users. It includes a foreign key to the User model and to the Job model to show us which user is applying for which job. Both users and jobs have ids on them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>User Authentication</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We used the allauth to let the user created/log in to their accounts. I also Django's LoginRequired is used to make sure that the user cannot apply for any jobs unless they have logged into their account before applying for any of the jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Forms</h2>
<p>If the form is empty or incorrect the form will not be submitted. If an text box hasn't been filled or has been entered incorrectly but the user clicks submit the form doesn't get sent and the user is informed where the error is.</p>

![321615314-69605279-7bff-4148-b072-8537e51c814b](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/9ed6eef8-1987-4906-a6ed-27bc0b75ec8d)
<h2>Database</h2>
<p>The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database</p>
<h2>Error Pages</h2>
<p>Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error, in the middle of the page the user will see the home button and navbar to get them off the page</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>logo</h3>
<p>Created the logo by using the Shopify Logo Maker, I used the logo on top of the page and used the logo as my favicon.</p>

<h3>Navbar</h3>
<p>This is the navbar whether the user is looking at this via a computer screen but if they are using a smaller screen they will see a menu toggle bar that brings up the navbar in the same style</p>

![321617306-a094ce20-6878-42f4-8722-5a504961964b](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/2335106a-4edd-479e-801c-59c328986c9f)

<h3>Footer</h3>
<p>Footer has 4 social  icons but they are not linked to any social media profile as I didn't create a Rudgeys Recuriment accounts.</p>

![321616604-2b4b31cf-a5dd-404b-9424-afec3e940531](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/8eb7ddec-ba8e-4e06-97a7-32a8585a29ea)
<h2>Index.html</h2>
<p>The index page just goes into detail about who the company is and the services they can provide whether you are looking for a job or looking to hire someone in the Warrington area. I have also added the lighthouse score.</p>

![321617973-e284fd80-d70f-46ea-81e0-53be5a60d4ab](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/aaa9e74f-f661-41af-81c8-c0c9367c362c)
<h2>Jobs.html</h2>
<p>In my jobs page I have created a job board, this shows 5 jobs per page and if the user sees a job they would like to apply they just need to click on the apply button which will take them to the new page.</p>

![321617976-2e69e59f-e265-460d-9a76-4623676b6985](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/f521f72c-9303-4359-9178-b036d6864814)
<h2>Applying.html</h2>
<p>After the user has clicked on the job they would like to apply for they are taken to this form. If the user has yet to log in they will be redirected to the login page where they will be asked to log in. Once the user has logged the information in their profile.html will transfer over to the form filling the form out for them, this saves the user from having to enter their details over and over again. Once they are happy to submit the form the form then gets sent to an email address and the admin panel</p>

![321617963-a7affcb9-6ab7-46f1-9921-5ddd8e626a47](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/e04d2a8d-fdf9-4dad-a302-07b418adecef)
<h2>Advertising.html</h2>
<p>We then have our advertising page, this goes into a little bit more detail in how we can advertise roles. There is also an example of how we want the form to be filled out. Originally I wanted to add a word document for the user to download and fill out but was unable to achieve this. When the user clicks the Advertise my role button they will be redirected to the hiring page where they can take the next steps into advertising their role.</p>

![321617958-d158e13c-636e-4bca-a929-fafffca4d577](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/966b59d7-bb62-45da-bdd9-b1d7e1edbc07)
<h2>Hiring.html</h2>
<p>We have a form that the user can fill out explaining who the company is, their contact details, explanation of the job and if they have any attachments they may like to include. Once the user has filled this form they click submit where they will be redirected to another page advising the form has been submitted. The form then gets sent to an email and the admin panel.</p>

![321617971-7873f44e-931d-41da-8dc5-47242f9bc33f](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/f6791e4a-5364-4365-990d-35fe9abb5dc4)
<h2>Contact.html</h2>
<p>Contact form is created encase the user has any question that haven't been answered or they would like more information. Once the form has been submitted it is sent to an email address and the admin panel.</p>

![321617967-3e2a3559-9970-4f71-a0c0-14534707e424](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/f9680284-7698-4609-9919-ff0624bce521)
<h2>Submitted - All 3.html</h2>
<p>I have created 3 submitted pages with pretty much the same information bar a paragraph. Once the user has submitted either one of the job application, contact or hiring forms the form is sent to an email and the admin panel and the user is then re-directed  to the submitted.html where it explains the next steps. Exmaple being if the user has filled out the contact form they get redirected to the submitted_contact.html telling them what we do with the contact form and how long they should have to wait for an update.</p>

![submitted lighthouse](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/c32ca629-652d-4b50-8f3c-e647734e34a5)
<h2>Signup.html</h2>
<p>Form for the user to fill in order to create their account. Once the account has been created they are then redirected to their account.</p>

![321617950-1a092856-3f8b-4964-932a-2a54303dbd2d](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/ea666055-0c35-4e63-97c5-25b058c60869)
<h2>Profile.html</h2>
<p>Once the user has signed up or logged in they are redirected to their account page where they can either add or edit their details. Once the user has added or edited their details they click the save button where a message on top of the page asks them to confirm the changes. This is where we take the information from this page and add this to our applying form to stop the user from having to re-enter their details when they apply for more than one job.</p>

![321617984-73e382d7-2498-49f2-9c28-b353d241fba5](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/92183215-596f-4dc0-ae44-d4a0d9e4ad0c)
<h2>Login.html</h2>
<p>Form for the user to fill in order to log into their account. Once the user has logged in they are then redirected to their account.</p>

![321617982-cdf6b373-5e54-4b8a-8839-ebee73582ef5](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/961e0d21-8c57-45cd-aef6-6c50e06bcd7c)

<h2>Logout</h2>
<p>I didn't user the log out page that was created when I added the allauth, instead I used the logout in the navbar as a button where once the user would like to log out they click the logout and then a message appears at the top confirming if they want to log out.</p>

![logout](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/9c9d6a0c-c448-41d9-a71c-dece5ef578cc)
<h2>Admin Panel - Creating Jobs</h2>
<p>Here is where the external user can create jobs, they have job title, job benefits, address, job description, job requirements, deadline date (meaning cvs must be sent in before 07/05 for example) interview times and notes. The user who's viewing the app won't see the notes they are for the external user to add details like the comapny email address where they need to send the cvs the external user has approved ext.</p>

![Admin - jobs part 1](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/b6c0d2cb-7ca0-477c-ac1b-edcec00094ea)

<h2>Admin Panel -  Job Applications</h2>
<p>When the user has finds a job they would like to apply for they are directed to the applying.html where the information in the profile gets transfered over to the form, once the user is happy to submit the form the form then gets submitted to both the admin panel and an email address.</p>

![Admin - job app](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/70a4381d-c2e7-4918-97d3-7951d64e81ef)
<h2>Admin Panel - Creating Times</h2>
<p>Here the external user can create times for interviews. As an example I have created a list of times that last an hour.</p>

![times - admin](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/99c8be76-9086-491b-bda1-b07fa37fc475)

<h2>Admin Panel - Creating Notice</h2>
<p>Here the external user can create notice period for the user to apply in their account. As an example I have created a list for a week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks and so on.</p>

![Notice - Admin](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/352b0545-35e2-493a-a897-f301f8293ad3)

<h2>Admin Panel - Contact Form and Hiring Forms</h2>
<p>As stated before when a form has been submitted the form gets sent to both an email address and the admin panel. This is where the external user can see the form for this example it is the contact form, here they are able to see their contact information and see when is the best time to contact them.</p>

![Admin - Contact](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/a82af0f2-e153-4639-8f27-3c6cc6926036)

<h2>Testing Pages</h2>
<h4>Validator W3</h4>
<p>I have validated all the pages from my app. They all have been checked with no errors expect for one.</p>

![index w3c](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/135a499d-227b-4bb5-b6cf-201586efbd1d)
<p>The one with the error is on jobs, could not find the p tag in either the jobs.html or the admin panel where the job is created. Other than that the page is fine</p>

![jobs w3c](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/f87cf4f5-e2e0-4ce2-b45a-5175e5af1380)

<h4>CI Python Linter</h4>
<p>Check the python code in the Python Linter and all pages passed will now pass the check with no errors.</p>

<h4>JSHint</h4>
<p>I did create some javascript code to show a message for when the user would like to log out and for when the user has saved their profile details. Checked the code against the JSHint and there was only warnings no errors</p>

![JSHint](https://github.com/JoshRudge22/RR-Project4/assets/139856712/f87d50d2-d481-442a-af91-e9505b78ea44)
